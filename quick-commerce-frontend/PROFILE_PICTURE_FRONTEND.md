# Profile Picture Frontend Implementation

This document describes the frontend implementation of the profile picture functionality for the Quick Commerce application.

## Components Created

### 1. ProfilePictureUpload Component
**File:** `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.jsx`

A reusable component that handles profile picture upload, preview, and removal.

**Features:**
- ✅ File selection with JPG/JPEG validation
- ✅ File size validation (max 5MB)
- ✅ Image preview before upload
- ✅ Upload progress indication
- ✅ Remove existing profile picture
- ✅ Error and success message handling
- ✅ Responsive design with Material-UI

**Props:**
- `user`: Current user object
- `onProfileUpdate`: Callback function when profile is updated

**Usage:**
```jsx
import ProfilePictureUpload from './ProfilePictureUpload';

<ProfilePictureUpload 
  user={user} 
  onProfileUpdate={handleProfileUpdate}
/>
```

### 2. ProfilePictureTest Component
**File:** `src/components/ProfilePictureTest.jsx`

A standalone test page to demonstrate the profile picture functionality.

**Features:**
- ✅ Displays current user information
- ✅ Shows profile picture upload component
- ✅ Provides usage instructions
- ✅ Accessible at `/profile-picture-test` route

## API Integration

### Updated API Service
**File:** `src/services/apiService.js`

Added two new methods for profile picture management:

#### `uploadProfilePicture(file)`
Uploads a profile picture file to the server.

```javascript
const result = await apiService.uploadProfilePicture(file);
// Returns: { success: true, message: "...", profilePictureUrl: "..." }
```

#### `removeProfilePicture()`
Removes the current user's profile picture.

```javascript
const result = await apiService.removeProfilePicture();
// Returns: { success: true, message: "..." }
```

## Integration with UserProfile

The profile picture functionality has been integrated into the existing `UserProfile` component:

### 1. Profile Picture Display
- Updated the main profile card to show uploaded profile pictures
- Falls back to Google picture if no custom profile picture is set
- Shows user initials as fallback

### 2. Upload Interface
- Added `ProfilePictureUpload` component to the "Personal Info" tab
- Integrated with existing user context updates
- Maintains consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Routes Added

### `/profile-picture-test`
A dedicated test page to demonstrate the profile picture functionality.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd Quick-CommerceApiForEx
dotnet run
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd quick-commerce-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Functionality

#### Option A: Use the Test Page
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/profile-picture-test`
2. Log in if not already authenticated
3. Use the upload interface to test profile picture functionality

#### Option B: Use the Profile Page
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/profile`
2. Go to the "Personal Info" tab
3. Use the profile picture upload section

### 4. Test Scenarios
- ✅ Upload a JPG image (should work)
- ✅ Upload a PNG image (should show error)
- ✅ Upload a file larger than 5MB (should show error)
- ✅ Preview image before upload
- ✅ Remove existing profile picture
- ✅ Verify profile picture appears in main profile card

## Styling

The components use Material-UI for consistent styling:
- Cards with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Loading states with circular progress indicators
- Error and success alerts
- Consistent color scheme with the rest of the application

## Error Handling

The frontend includes comprehensive error handling:
- File type validation (JPG/JPEG only)
- File size validation (max 5MB)
- Network error handling
- Server error handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses modern web APIs:
- File API for file selection
- FileReader API for image preview
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- FormData for file uploads

Compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Security Considerations

- File type validation on both frontend and backend
- File size limits enforced
- Authentication required for all operations
- User can only modify their own profile picture
- Secure file upload handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Image cropping functionality
- Multiple image format support (PNG, WebP)
- Image compression before upload
- Drag and drop file upload
- Camera capture support for mobile devices
